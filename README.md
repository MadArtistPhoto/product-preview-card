## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


This is a bit of an update. I got frustrated with GitHub, as it is so extremely un-intuitive, so I deleted all my repositories and started over. In doing so I updated some all of the challenges.

## My process

### Built with

- VSCode
- a bit of Notepad++
- Paint.net to figure out some layout sizes.
- PikPik for geting some of the colors from the design guides

### What I learned

Okay, This is the first time I tried this. I learned...

- That I have a lot more to learn *
- Chasing down typing, punctuation, coding errore is a challenge
- Using vw and vh for responsive measurements
- How to include Google Fonts
- How to really mess it up and start over from scratch
- Learned about VSCode, though I have only scratched the surface of its power.
- Learned about Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. Some of the most un-intuitive stuff I have ever run across. But I keep plugging at it.
- Learned about about Markdown and README pages. I'm not much of a journal keeper, but I can see how doing this can be a good way to track my progress and direction

### Continued development

- See the first comment above *
- Need to figure out the different screen size changes and how to implement them to fit different screens better
- Need to learn more about responsive sizing for pages, items, fonts
- Need to learn more about Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. Just using them in future projects will help (hopefully).

Watching a lot of videos:
- Linked in Learning with Lynda (through my local library)
- And too many others to mention here. (I will start compiling some of my favorites.)
